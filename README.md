## 📋 Project Description
The **Coworking Reservation System** is a web application designed to facilitate the booking of coworking spaces, with a special focus on promoting gender equality, social innovation, and feminist economics. The main goal is to maximize resource usage, avoid scheduling conflicts, and enable effective space management.

This system is aimed at entrepreneurs, small businesses, and projects focused on equal opportunities, providing a collaborative space and technical assistance to promote business growth.

- Build **data access components**.
- Develop a user interface with **content management** capabilities.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Styled Components, Axios
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito
- **Tools**: Figma, Visual Studio Code, Trello, Jira, Git, GitHub, Discord
